                Programming is being influenced by AI to a great extent. 
                This is why there have been questions regarding the future of programming in light of the recent developments 
                of the likes of ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and other LLMs.

            <div id="secondHeader"><h2>What difference does AI make? </h2></div>   
            <div id='text2' class="text">The main difference AI makes in coding is speeding up the process to a great extent. 
                Other than that, AI can also code entire web pages, backend projects, and the likes which enable even the most beginner-level coder 
                to have a great reach at what he can do. 
                This is also the case to a great extent in Software Development and Engineering.  </div>  
            <div id="thirdHeader"><h2>Are humans needed anymore?</h2></div>    
            <div id='text3' class="text">Currently, yes. 
                Though AI is really good at coding, it still makes a lot of mistakes when the process gets more complicated.
                 Where humans can solve the underlying problems, because of the way AI is programmed, 
                 it is harder for it to come up with a new way of solution to more unique problems.   </div>
