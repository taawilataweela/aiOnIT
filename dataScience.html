                <q>AI has been having a big impact on Data Science already. 
                    After a long time of mainly relying on the meticulous systemized data arrived at by humans,
                    which took a significant amount of time, Data Science welcomes AI’s arrival with open arms. </q>

            <div id="secondHeader"><h2>What can AI do?</h2></div>   
            <div id='text2' class="text">AI excels at predictive analytics, where future patterns are predicted. 
                It is also good analyzing large scale data that humans were not able to analyze at the same capacity before. 
                Another aspect of AI’s role in Data Science is the fact that it automizes the process of analyzing the data provided, speeding up the entire process. </div>  
            <div id="thirdHeader"><h2>Are humans needed anymore?</h2></div>    
            <div id='text3' class="text">That’s the key question, are humans needed anymore? 
                The answer is yes, if they can adapt to the new world of Data Science and Analytics. 
                It can be said that an old-school data scientist who has not adapted to the way AI influences Data Science, should expect to lose his job. 
                It can even be said that new graduates have an advantage in this case, since they are not used to the old-school way yet. </div>
